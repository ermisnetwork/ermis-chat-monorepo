# @ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk

The official core SDK for Ermis Chat.

## Public Module Structure

<details>
<summary>Change log</summary>

- `2026-07-03`: Kept the public npm package under the official `@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk` scoped name.
  - Reason: keep the SDK aligned with the existing Ermis public package name before wider adoption.
  - Integrator action: install/import `@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk` and use `@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk/encryption` for encryption-only imports.
  - Compatibility/default: runtime APIs and package exports are unchanged; only the npm package name and module specifier changed from the temporary unscoped naming. Any temporary package names should be deprecated on npm.

</details>

- Customer integrations should import from the package root, for example `import { ErmisChat, EncryptionManager, loadOpenMlsWasm } from '@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk'`.
- Encryption-specific integrations may import from `@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk/encryption`, which exposes `E2eeClient`, `EncryptionManager`, `IndexedDBEncryptionStorage`, `loadOpenMlsWasm`, public encryption types, and friendly aliases `EncryptionApiClient` and `BrowserEncryptionStorage`.
- Deep imports from `@ermis-network/ermis-chat-sdk/src/*` are intentionally unsupported. The package publishes `dist/` and runtime assets from `public/`, not TypeScript source files.
- Apps using OpenMLS must publish `openmls_wasm_bg.wasm` with their web assets. The SDK package includes this binary under `public/openmls_wasm_bg.wasm`; `loadOpenMlsWasm('/openmls_wasm_bg.wasm')` loads the bundled JS glue and that public binary.

## E2EE Channel Helpers

<details>
<summary>Change log</summary>

- `2026-06-19`: E2EE message hydration now preserves sender display names when local user cache only contains a bare user id.

  - Reason: freshly sent encrypted messages can otherwise replace the current user's name/email with the raw id in timelines and channel previews.
  - Integrator action: rebuild SDK/React clients so encrypted message state uses the richer user object already available on the client.
  - Compatibility/default: if no display name is available locally, clients keep the existing id fallback.

- `2026-06-19`: E2EE message hydration now resolves `quoted_message` from decrypted local state or IndexedDB when only `quoted_message_id` is present, including sticker quotes stored as `type: 'sticker'`.

  - Reason: quoted replies in encrypted channels must preview the replied-to plaintext without requiring Bellboy to decrypt or duplicate message bodies.
  - Integrator action: rebuild SDK/React clients so reply previews can hydrate from local encrypted-message cache.
  - Compatibility/default: if the quoted message is not available locally, clients keep the existing unavailable-message fallback.

- `2026-06-19`: Added `restoreProgressWithIssues` to `client.encryptionManager.getRecoveryStatus()`.
  - Reason: account-level PIN settings need channel-level unavailable-history diagnostics without showing permanent-gap warnings inside every channel.
  - Integrator action: prefer the new records when rendering global PIN/history diagnostics; keep `getRestoreProgress(channelType, channelId)` for selected-channel progress and repair flows.
  - Compatibility/default: existing `incompleteChannels` and `channelsWithPermanentGaps` arrays remain unchanged.

</details>

- `channel.removeMembersE2ee(members, e2eeOptions)` removes other members from an E2EE channel with an encryption commit and sends `self_remove: false`.
- `channel.leaveChannelE2ee(userId)` self-leaves an E2EE channel by sending `self_remove: true`; this path does not include an encryption commit from the leaving user.
- `client.encryptionManager.setupRecoveryPin(pin)`, `unlockRecoveryVault(pin)`, `changeUnlockedRecoveryPin(newPin)`, and the compatibility `changeRecoveryPin(oldPin, newPin)` manage the PIN recovery vault. PIN verification and rewrap remain client-side.
- `client.encryptionManager.restoreHistoricalMessages(channelType, channelId, options)` restores accessible historical E2EE ciphertexts from account-owned epoch archives and returns explicit gap entries when archive material is missing.
- `client.encryptionManager.repairEncryptedChannel(channelType, channelId, { mode: 'replay' })` is the user-facing Channel Info repair API. It replays from the last safe sync cursor, flushes pending encrypted snapshots, and runs chat-history repair if the PIN is unlocked.
- `client.encryptionManager.repairEncryptedChannel(channelType, channelId, { mode: 'reset_local_state' })` is an advanced manual fallback after replay failure. It reloads the local encryption state through external join while keeping decrypted message cache and repair issues.
- `client.encryptionManager.repairRecoveryChannel(channelType, channelId, { mode })` repairs persisted failed message versions with `failed_only` or rechecks the selected timeline with `recheck_channel`.
- Sync cursors are stored as `{ created_at, event_id }`; the SDK commits the cursor that was actually processed, not the server batch cursor, and IndexedDB checkpoints provider bytes plus cursor in one meta transaction when available.
- During encrypted-state repair, a local group epoch lower than known failed message epochs makes the saved sync cursor untrusted; replay starts from the membership/encryption-enabled boundary, then archive repair is attempted before reset availability is returned if the device is still behind.
- During manual repair, archive epoch listings with no matching epoch mark the affected message-level issues as `no_archive` instead of leaving stale `decrypt_error` reasons.
- E2EE quoted replies hydrate `quoted_message` from active decrypted state or IndexedDB when Bellboy only returns `quoted_message_id`.
- For non-gated E2EE topics, historical restore queries parent archive material by `e2ee_group_id` and routes restored plaintext into each timeline by `ciphertext.cid`.
- `client.encryptionManager.getRecoveryStatus()` reports vault existence, memory-only unlock state, incomplete restore channels, channels that completed with permanent gaps, and the issue-bearing restore progress records that account PIN settings can summarize.
- `client.encryptionManager.getRestoreProgress(channelType, channelId)` returns the per-device restore progress record for active restore progress and diagnostics.
- Restore progress is persisted per device in IndexedDB so interrupted history restore resumes only missing epochs after the user re-enters their PIN.
- Message-level `repair_issues` share that existing progress record, so new failures in completed epochs are not hidden and no IndexedDB version bump is required.
- Restore runs sequentially by channel and fetches target epochs in bounded batches/ranges before saving progress per epoch.
- The SDK loads recovery public metadata during encryption initialization, so devices can upload account-owned archives while still locked and only require PIN entry for private-key restore.
- Recovery vault lookup is cached and in-flight de-duplicated inside `EncryptionManager`; repeated recovery status refreshes read local vault state instead of repeatedly calling `GET /recovery/vault`.
- Fresh epoch archives are exported after channel creation and after every fresh epoch. If no recovery vault exists yet, the archive ADK is stashed locally under a device-local non-extractable WebCrypto AES-GCM key and uploaded after PIN setup/vault discovery.
- Archive failures are best-effort: commit/join/rotate flows keep the encryption epoch change and retain retryable archive work locally.
- New E2EE channel creation and `client.encryptionManager.enableE2ee()` can pass `e2ee_recovery_policy` as `member_assisted` or `self_owned_only`. The default server/client behavior remains `member_assisted`.
- `client.encryptionManager.bootstrapKnownE2eeChannels()` scans loaded E2EE channels after `channels.queried`, external-joins missing local groups sequentially, emits `e2ee.bootstrap_progress`, and queues restore after PIN unlock.
- E2EE non-gated topics inherit the parent `e2ee_group_id` and recovery policy; gated topics keep a topic-owned encryption group and their own policy.
- Reconnect catch-up uses `/v1/e2ee/scope_sync` with one `{ created_at, event_id }` cursor per E2EE scope.
- Opening an already-ready E2EE channel reuses the local encryption group, persisted scope cursor, and last `ready` sync state instead of calling `/v1/e2ee/scope_sync` again; reconnect, missing local state, `has_more`, and repair paths still sync.
- The SDK dispatches `e2ee.initialized` after encryption manager initialization, allowing app recovery gates to refresh once E2EE is ready.
- The SDK dispatches `e2ee.restore_progress` after restore progress changes; UI clients can subscribe to refresh status without polling.
- The SDK dispatches `e2ee.bootstrap_progress` while startup external-join preparation is running; UI clients can show non-blocking secure-restore preparation progress.

## SDK Logging

`ErmisChatOptions.logger` is optional. When it is not provided, SDK runtime logs are no-op, including E2EE/encryption storage, OpenMLS WASM wrapper warnings/errors, media/call helpers, and worker messages.

For quick browser integration, pass console levels directly: `logger: ['info', 'warn', 'error']`. `info` uses `console.log`; `warn` uses `console.warn`; `error` uses `console.error`. For custom routing, pass a function logger; it receives `info`, `warn`, or `error` as the first argument, the formatted message as the second argument, and optional structured metadata as the third argument.
